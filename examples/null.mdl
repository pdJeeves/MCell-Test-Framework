 *    This elaborate and finely crafted simulation was constructed in response
 *    to a request by Tom to determine why MCell 3 doing nothing runs more
 *    slowly than MCell 2 doing nothing, and whether it wasn't perhaps possible
 *    to improve the situation somewhat.  It's probably not an unreasonable
 *    test case.
