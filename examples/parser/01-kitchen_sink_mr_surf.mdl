/****************************************************************************
 * Test 01: Nearly every parser option.
 *
 *    A mostly non-sensical test which simply exercises the parser checking for
 *    anomalous behavior.  This test should not provoke any errors, provided
 *    that counting-5.txt does not exist in its reaction output directory.
 *    (This is to test the "no overwrite" output mode for counting.)
 *
 *    This variant produces no viz output, and turns on microscopic
 *    surface reversibility.
