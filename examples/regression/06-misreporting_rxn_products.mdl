/****************************************************************************
 * Regression test 06: Misreporting reaction products.
 *
 *    This is in response to a bug report from Boris, who noticed that recent
 *    versions of MCell, when given reactions:
 *
 *      a+b -> c [rate1]
 *      a+b -> d [rate2]
 *      a+b -> e [rate3]
 *
 *     would give three probability reports with different probabilities, as
 *     appropriate, but the reports would all reference the same set of
 *     products.
 *
 *
 *    Failure: output includes lines which look like:
 *      Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
 *        Probability 3.6790e-04 set for a{0} + b{0} -> c{0}
 *        Probability 7.3581e-04 set for a{0} + b{0} -> c{0}
 *        Probability 1.1037e-03 set for a{0} + b{0} -> c{0}
 *
 *    Success: output includes lines which look like:
 *      Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
 *        Probability 3.6790e-04 set for a{0} + b{0} -> c{0}
 *        Probability 7.3581e-04 set for a{0} + b{0} -> d{0}
 *        Probability 1.1037e-03 set for a{0} + b{0} -> e{0}
