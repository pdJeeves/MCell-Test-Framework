/****************************************************************************
 * Regression test 08: Assertion fails when deep copying certain objects.
 *
 *    This is a bug encountered by Daniel Sherwood (2008-04-24).  When a
 *    release site is cloned into a metaobject and the release site referred to
 *    a region in the original template object, and the fully qualified name of
 *    the release site was longer than the fully qualified name of the region,
 *    an assertion failure would occur due to an incorrect length calculation.
 *
 *    Failure: MCell aborts (SIGABRT)
 *    Success: MCell does not crash
