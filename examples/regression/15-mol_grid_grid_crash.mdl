 * Regression test 15: Under certain circumstances, mol-grid-grid reactions
 *    could lead to a crash.  The wrong variable was being used to index into
 *    the array of matching reactions in the mol-grid-grid case, causing mcell
 *    to access outside the bounds of the array.  This may not reliably fail,
 *    and may depend on the compiler and architecture.
 *
 *    Failure: crash
 *    Success: run exits successfully
