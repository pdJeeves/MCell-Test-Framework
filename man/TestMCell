.SH NAME
TestMCell \- test framework for the Mcell stochastic diffusion simulator
.SH SYNOPSIS
MCellTest [--threads=] --query [query]
.SH DESCRIPTION
TestMCell reads in python scripts from the folder specified in it's config file and runs ones which begin with a """ marker, if they match the given query.  If they have already been run after this version of mcell was compiled then the data from the previous run is used rather than running it again. It will be run anyway if the python script is more recent than the last run data. However if that is the case it will rerun the python script-it will rerun Mcell rather than using data from a previous run iff the .mdl is more recent than the data.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--force" 
run all python files regardless of if there is data from previous runs.
.IP "--threads=[number]" 
Run the framework with the given number of threads, defaults to 4, this includes the thread that spawns the MCell processes. 
.IP "--all" 
run all of the python files in the directory.
.IP "--query" 
the query to search keywords in the script files against.
.SH FILES
TestMCell has a config file in '~/.config/TestMCell' containing the path to MCell, the location to place MCell's output, the path to the scripts it will run, the location to place their output, and the path to the dependencies of those scripts, all of these must be quoted absolute paths.
.P
When TestMCell is searching for scripts to run it will ignore any file whose path doesn't end with .py or contain """ as the first string in the file.  Everything in this block comment which is between two curly brackets is a keyword.  If a keyword follows the regex [0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2} then it is considered a YYYY/MM/DD date, if there is more than one then the last one found is used.  keywords may contain spaces if they are between single or double quotes.
.SH QUERY SYNTAX
Keywords are not case sensitive.

.SH BUGS
It is not capable of determining if the .mdl is more recent without running the python script.
If more than one thread is used then python syntax errors will cause segfaults.
