/****************************************************************************
 * Test 02: Real-time checkpoint options.
 *
 *    A series of tests which checkpoint and exit after 30 seconds.  At the
 *    beginning of the test, a timestamp file is created.  Checking the
 *    timestamp on this file (also stored as an integer in the file, as seconds
 *    since the epoch) against the timestamp on the checkpoint file should give
 *    a reasonable, though not utterly infallible test.
 *
 *    This variant has an exit spec and time specified in hours, minutes, and
 *    seconds, where only the hourss are positive, and all other values are
 *    negative.  This should help if the computation of the alarm time is
 *    compromised somehow.
