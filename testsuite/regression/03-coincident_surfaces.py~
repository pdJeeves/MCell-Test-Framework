  Regression test 03: When two surfaces coincide and one of them is
        transparent, odd things happen.  Counting, for one, can become
        confused.  Essentially, the transparent surface may be re-collided in
        certain cases.

        Failure: counts go negative, or extremely positive
                 total count of cannonballs != 500

        Success: for entire run, count 122L+122R == 122 == 500  AND
                 for entire run, count r122L+r122R == r122 == 500

  Note: As of 05/23/2011 we disallow overlapped walls, so the coodinates
        of box122R are slightly shifted.
