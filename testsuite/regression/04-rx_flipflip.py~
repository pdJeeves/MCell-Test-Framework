  Regression test 04: When two surface molecules undergo a reaction in which
        both reagents are preserved, and in which both reagents change
        orientation, counting does not occur properly.

        Failure: as flippy increases, a000- and b000- remain 0

        Success: a000- and b000- increase to non-zero values
                 flippy increases
